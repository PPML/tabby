# eyeglass

A tool for TB models.

## Installation

You must have access to the PPML GitHub organization in order to install the
eyeglass R package. If you need access, email <a
href="mailto:nteetor@hsph.harvard.edu">nteetor@hsph.harvard.edu</a>.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Please email if you need help with this step. 

1. Open the eyeglass folder as an RStudio project.

1. In the RStudio console run `devtools::load_all()`

1. Next, still in the RStudio console, run `launch()`

At this point the application should open in a new window. If at any point you have an issue, please email. It is important that you have access to the application and I am very willing to walk over and work through the installation with you.

## Updating

If you have already gone through the installation process, please make sure to pull down any changes from GitHub before launching the application again.

## Running the App

Make sure you are working in RStudio for best results. Once the eyeglass package
is installed, you can run the eyeglass application with the following code.

```R
eyeglass::launch()
```

A new window will open at this point.

## Feedback

The best place for feedback is on the
[Issues](https://github.com/PPML/eyeglass/issues) page. There you can create a 
new issue and the repository owner will be immediately notified. Furthermore, 
issues can be mentioned and closed from tags included in commit messages. This
makes tracking incremental progress that much easier. Because input may come
from multiple persons creating an issues reduces redundencies, allows for you
to add to previously raised issue, and keeps all current bugs and problems in 
one location.

Giving them a try would be much appreciated.

If you do not feel comfortable creating an issue you may also email <a 
href="mailto:nteetor@hsph.harvard.edu">nteetor@hsph.harvard.edu</a> with any 
questions or concerns. Furthermore, issues are public to anyone with access to
the repository, so if you have a concern you prefer to keep private please send
an email.
